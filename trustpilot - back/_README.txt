The algos are not optimized but that was enough for the job.

Before running the following, I first prune the dictionnary from all words that cannot be written with the given anagram.

1 - compute.sh
2 - unique_seq.sh
3 - check_md5.sh

param file is there so that we can let the computer rest for a while :D (it contains the restart values for i and j in compute.sh)
